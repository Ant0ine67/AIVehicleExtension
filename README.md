# AIVehicleExtension for Farming Simulator 2017

## Status
Minimum patch level is Farming Simulator 2017 patch 1.3.1, but patch 1.4 is supported as well. I only test it with patch 1.4.4.
The core path finding engine ("AutoSteeringEngine") is working now and most turn maneuvers seem to work quite well. 
I moved many settings into a new settings GUI. 
I publish it in GitHub because I need the backup and versioning support from GitHub. 

## Motivation
I do not like maps with rectangular fields. But driving a combine harvester plus the tractor with trailer is a bit tedious in SP mode. 

## Description
The Mod is installed easily in the mod folder. 
It is automatically added in all AIVehicles. 
Thus the combine threshes automatically in circles around the field.

## How to
The AutoCombine Hud is opened with the key 5. The helper starts normally using the H key.
Warning: You must turn on the alternative helper only in Hud. 
The button is in the 2nd Row far left. Is there a quadrilateral, then only the normal helper is on.
